## Overview
This repository is for small C and C++ programs I do outside of my school work.

## C Programs
- addingFormattedNums.c
    - print two rows one increasing one decreasing
- binarySearch.c
    - first implementation of a binary search (those were the days)
- binarySearch2.c
    - second implementation of a binary search
- bubbleSort.c
    - everyone loves bubbles
- compareArr.c
    - Return -1 if an element of array1 is less than array2, return 1 if an element of array1 is greater than array2, return 0 otherwise
- factorial.c
    - recursive factorial in c, bad use of recursion but still fun
- insertionSort.c
- linearSearch.c
- linkedList.c
    - first implementation of linked list
- loopPointers
- mergesort.c
    - first implementation of merge sort
- quicksort.c
    - first implementaion of quick sort
- randNum.c
    - seeding random numbers
- reverse.c
    reverse an array in place
- reverseStr.c
    reverse string
- selectionSort.c
- squareCalc.c
    - return the square of a number with just addition
    - inductive assert
- textAnim.c
    - terminal text animation

    - my solution for Google Kick Start round C, question 1
- barPblm.cpp
    - algorithm practice
- barPblm2.cpp
    - more direct solution

    - three ways of making the fibonacci sequence
    - naive recursive, memoized recursive, and sequential
- hashtable.cpp
- mergeSort.cpp
- multiplyWithAdd.cpp
    - multiplication using only addition
- numOfBSTs.cpp
    - number of BST's that can be made with a given number
- proveEvenNums.cpp
    - induction proof for printing even numbers
- reverseMerge.cpp
    - sort in descending order
- reverseStr.cpp
- romanToDecimal.cpp
    - given roman numerals, return a decimal number
- strReverseInP.cpp
    - reverse string in place
- word2num.cpp
    - given a word (two thousand five hundred and one) a number is returned (2501)
